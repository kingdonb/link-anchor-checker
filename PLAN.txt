Plan:

do the fermyon examples so I know how to install gems in a wasm
make a kubernetes-operator that has a few things:

* serves web interface
* takes a fluxcd/pkg name as part of a spec in operator style
* the interval says how often to perform a collection
* the collection process runs the gammo wasm module

* the user should also be able to fetch the latest number from in their browser
* we need to account for rate limiting, if the rate limit is hit we should be able to discard that as an error
* it should be possible for the user to show or discard errors in their browser

Fermyon Spin

Talk to kingdon@weave.works about this. Or pull from his GitHub repo's explanation.

(From Kingdon: "Spin's underlying technologies begin from a simple idea: most
programming problems are either a bit more like CLI tools (WASI), more like web
servers (Wagi), or a bit like packaged libraries (Wasm). Have a look at these
repos to hear about Spin's fantastic voyage."

* FluxCD Stats Tracker App in Wasm: https://github.com/kingdonb/stats-tracker-ghcr
* Bartholomew Blog on Kubernetes: https://github.com/kingdonb/taking-bartholo
* Fermyon's most aggressive examples repo, Spin + Kitchen Sink:
  https://github.com/fermyon/spin-kitchensink#spin-example-components

While I did find most everything I needed here, and I was able to adapt this
for Kubernetes, I felt right on a bleeding edge the whole time. As a Rubyist
and Kubernetes enthusiast both alike, I truly wonder who has already been down
any of these roads, and how did they find them?)

Also, despite what you may have heard, and while Fermyon Cloud is indeed a
closed product... Fermyon's (Spin's) critical path is basically entirely built
on open source, (see Hippo Factory):

* https://docs.hippofactory.dev/intro/install-hippo/
* https://docs.hippofactory.dev/

From: "Understanding Hippo's Design
NOTE: As of current writing, the actual Hippo data model and flow are not quite
where this document says they are. That’s because Hippo is ~a journey~ a work
in progress, and we’re figuring things out as we go." – Statement from "Hippo
Factory," may help to set expectations.
